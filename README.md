# Sample Hardhat Project

# Initializing the HardHat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

"npx hardhat node" and "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost" should run on separate terminals
After deploying "npx hardhat node"
--> Connect metamask with the localhost url birthed after running command
-->Import an account in metamask using the private keys of the ethereum accounts created by hardhat

# To Initialize Project

```shell1 shell2              shell3
npm run dev         npx hardhat node     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
